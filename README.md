## Project Overview

MetricX is designed to provide real-time website analytics and uptime monitoring, offering a detailed view of website performance and health. By utilizing a real Chrome browser instance for data capture, the platform ensures accuracy and reliability in its reports. Instant notifications via mobile (using FCM) and email alert users of any issues, ensuring swift resolution.

The project was started in August 2024 and is currently ongoing, with a focus on expanding feature sets and improving system scalability.

## Features

- **Real-Time Analytics:** Track website performance in real-time using a real browser instance.
- **Uptime Monitoring:** Keep track of uptime across various regions, with escalation procedures in place for downtime.
- **Instant Notifications:** Receive immediate alerts via mobile and email for any performance or availability issues.
- **Region-wise Analytics:** Break down performance data by region for deeper insights.
- **Mobile Integration:** Android support for receiving instant notifications via push messages using FCM.

## Architecture

MetricX follows a modern, modular architecture designed for scalability and reliability. The core layers include:

- **Backend Services:** Developed using Ktor and Flask for high performance and flexibility.
- **Data Pipeline:** Kafka is used to handle real-time data streams, ensuring a continuous flow of analytics data.
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL is used for structured data storage and efficient query management.
- **Containerization:** Docker is employed for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring smooth deployment and scaling across environments.
- **Load Balancing:** Nginx is used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to distribute traffic efficiently across multiple instances.
